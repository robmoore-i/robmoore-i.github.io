# WIP: Governance is not a quality strategy

In this page, I rehash Deming's truism:

> Inspection does not improve the quality, nor guarantee quality. Inspection is too late. The quality, good or bad, is already in the product. As Harold F. Dodge said, “You can not inspect quality into a product.”

## Problem: Low quality work

We are having problems producing work that is of as high quality as the work we've produced in the past. We're catching bugs late in development and some embarrassing bugs that we should have caught are going all the way to customers, harming our business and our reputation. We need to improve quality, and fast!

## Not a solution: Quality gates

There are varying degrees to which different engineering organisations get this wrong.

- Very wrong: Introduction of a manual testing / approval step.
- Less, but still very wrong: Code coverage must be X%.
- Wrong, but starting to think in the right direction: All changes must include automated tests.

Below I discuss the approaches I think are more likely to be effective.

## Real solutions require engineers to produce higher quality work

I've listed these in order, ranked by my opinion, starting with the 'best', as in most likely to have a positive impact.

### Making it easier for your engineers to do better work

I hope you saw this coming. If you want better work to happen in your engineering organisation, and you don't believe in miracles, then you need to create an environment in which people are capable of simply doing better work. This is absolutely doable, and I think a sizable amount of it comes down to getting out of the way, and removing busywork.

#### Introducing tools that help engineers do better work

Introducing good tools can help engineers to focus on solving problems that add value (and avoid incomplete/broken re-implementations for functionality that you can get using existing tools). 

#### Streamlining processes to reduce interruptions and distractions

Hour-long standups are actually very bad.

#### Removing and mitigating high-friction developer experiences

It should be somebody's job to make everybody more productive and keep them productive by solving problems that distract them for value-adding work.

### Helping your existing engineers to become more skilled

#### Pair programming

A great way to transfer skills and create an organisation full of your best few people.

#### Empowering your known best engineers to set the engineering culture

As above.

### Hiring more skilled engineers

No matter what you do, a team of offshore developers from <budget-friendly developing nation> might not be able to acquire the skills you need them to, to deliver the quality of work you need delivered, in the time frame that you need it delivered in. You might need to hire new, local people, who are experienced, skilled, and yes, more expensive!

#### Probation periods are useful

I think it's a good sign when an engineering organisation isn't afraid to let people go when it clearly isn't a good fit. Sometimes, a person has great credentials, super relevant experience, they aced the interview, but somehow they never manage to take off on the job. This is what probation periods are for, and when a company never uses it, I think it's a bad sign. The organisation will just go on accumulating median performers forever until the organisation itself is a median performer (a fate you don't want in this economy).
