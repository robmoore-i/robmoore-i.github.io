# Year summary: 2025

Organised thematically, rather than chronologically.

## Grandma

Grandma sadly passed away this year. She was so lovable. I wish I called her more. Much more. Regrets aside, Grandma is now hanging out and no doubt having a fabulous time with her previously departed friends and family. In 40-70 years I'll join them too. It will be wonderful.

## Travel

Veera and I visited many countries. It was incredible, but tiring. Our week-long trip to the Gobi desert in Mongolia stands out as a truly unique experience. Driving through the wilderness, we often saw neither roads nor any other infrastructure. Just miles of shrubs in all directions, beyond the horizon. A few of our trips were physically taxing, none more so than hiking up Mount Kinabalu. The nausea from altitude sickness was terrible. Looking back, I'm glad we eventually climbed to the top, but I don't think we'll be summiting any tall mountains again for a little while. The constant in our trips that made them wonderful was to go with our friends. We are so lucky to have so many good friends.

## Cooking

Veera and I became a skilled team in cooking and baking. We cooked a broad variety of dishes, few of which belong to a single cuisine. In baking however we have a clear preference: We primarily bake chocolate cakes. We made a Christmas dinner a few days ago which aptly demonstrated the extent of our powers. We created a table of eight festive dishes and baked a unanimously lauded chocolate cake with chocolate ganache, using ingredients from our nearby grocery stores, all in under three hours.

## Work

My old therapist once said to me that not all growth is visible (picture a tree deepening its roots). This year, much of my growth was not visible. Work was fine, but I felt that I lacked energy much of the time. When our team was in the spotlight though, I performed well. In our annual performance reviews, my team had only kind words for me, which speaks to their generosity, and our team spirit.

## Project Euler

I returned to solving Project Euler puzzles towards the end of the year. It gave me some much-needed energy, allowing me to perform better at work when it counted.

## Bxg

My gym in Singapore, Bxg, closed down after running for 23 years. It was a wonderful place and we'll all miss it. My senior at the gym and the top fighter in Singapore in his weight class, Dejun, is opening a successor gym just down the road, so we'll go there in the new year when they open.
