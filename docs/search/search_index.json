Gradle provides a framework for modeling tasks, their dependencies and the artefacts they produce. The framework implements work avoidance, and provides a few common build task behaviours out-of-the-box. Since you can provide your model as code, it can benefit from flexibility and reuse in the same way as any other program you write, meaning that as your build gets larger and more complex, you can define ever more powerful abstractions for modeling your build.</p> <p>The documentation for this capability is unfortunately quite sparse. There are two main ways to do it, and the better way, which I will describe here, was introduced fairly recently.</p> <p>The best way to add custom build logic to your Gradle monorepo is to use included build plugins. That is, you have a directory underneath the root project, which is not a normal subproject. Instead, it is an included build. This directory contains its own settings script, to indicate that it is its own Gradle build, and like its parent, this is a multi-project build. The projects it contains define script Gradle plugins, which you can use to extract abstractions from project builds within its parent, in order to reuse them across many projects.</p> <p>The more well-known way to provide custom build logic in a Gradle build is to use buildSrc. This was the recommendation for a long time, but it has since become outdated. The reason for this is that any change you make to buildSrc invalidates up-to-date checks on every project in the build. As your build grows, this invalidation starts to become very expensive and makes it difficult to work productively on build logic.</p> <p>At even larger scale (i.e. literally thousands of subprojects), it can become economical to start publishing plugins to an internal repository and consuming them as external dependencies (i.e. using a buildscript block), rather than rebuilding the sources directly from within your monorepo.

There a toolchain definition, a custom task definition, and the registration of a couple of tasks. All of this is duplicated between the two projects in our build for no benefit, and you're not really thrilled about this.</p> <p>There is a way for us to elegantly extract appropriate abstractions and make both builds differ only in the way that matters. In this case, the projects differ in two dimensions: - They represent different Lambda functions - Their dependencies might be slightly different depending on what they do.</p> <p>The idiomatic way to extract common build logic is to use Gradle plugins. In this case, what we'd like is for both builds to declare that they are AWS Lambda functions by applying an appropriate plugin, and then configure some DSL that lets them specify the name of the function that they are.

However, it currently doesn't contain any plugins. We will now add the \"no-op\" plugin: A plugin that does nothing.</p> <p>I'll first create an empty subproject in the included build for Gradle plugins:</p> <pre><code>rob@Robs-MacBook-Pro-2 teashop % tree plugins\nplugins\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 no-op\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 build.gradle.kts\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 settings.gradle.kts\n</code></pre> <pre><code>/////////////////////////////////////\n//// plugins/settings.gradle.kts ////\n/////////////////////////////////////\nrootProject.name = \"plugins\"\ninclude(\":no-op\")\n</code></pre> <p>The next step is to turn the empty <code>no-op</code> project into a project that defines a Gradle plugin in Kotlin. This is not trivial, especially if you have never done it before. The first step is to apply the built-in <code>kotlin-dsl</code> Gradle plugin to the <code>no-op</code> project build:</p> <pre><code>////////////////////////////////////////\n//// gradle/plugins/no-op/build.gradle.kts ////\n////////////////////////////////////////\nplugins {\n    `kotlin-dsl`\n}\n\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Next, I run an Intellij sync, wait for it to complete, and then use Intellij to generate the main Kotlin source root by hovering over the project in Intellij's Project panel, using 'New' via CMD-N (or CTRL-N on Linux/Windows), selecting 'Directory' and then 'src/main/kotlin'. Whether by this method or another, the resuting directory structure of the plugins included build should be this:</p> <pre><code>rob@Robs-MacBook-Pro-2 teashop % tree gradle/plugins \nplugins\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 no-op\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 build.gradle.kts\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 main\n\u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 kotlin\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 settings.gradle.kts\n</code></pre> <p>The last step towards making an included build Gradle plugin is making a Gradle script under the newly created src/main/kotlin directory. The file's name needs to end with <code>.gradle.kts</code>. I have seen, and myself use the format: <code>&lt;org&gt;.&lt;plugin-name&gt;.gradle.kts</code>. In this example, I will create the file <code>teashop.no-op.gradle.kts</code>.

Other times, a plugin may be quite specific to one particular project build. Sometimes, a plugin registers tasks itself and the applying project doesn't need to do anything. Other times, it may be more appropriate for the plugin to instead add custom types onto the classpath of the applying project, so that the applying project can register and configure tasks for itself. Do whatever works in your context.</p> <p>One of the idiomatic ways to organise Gradle plugins is to describe what a project is. For example, when applying the <code>teashop.aws-lambda</code> plugin to the <code>teasite</code> project, you might read that as \"The teasite project is an AWS Lambda project\". Of course, many built-in plugins don't conform to that idiom, so I don't feel at all constrained by it.</p> <p>A pattern I often use is to define a script plugin that is completely empty, but defines useful classes and Kotlin functions that are added to the classpath of a applying project's build script. For example, if my <code>teashop.no-op</code> plugin was totally empty, I would still have been able to register tasks of type <code>SayHelloTask</code> within the teasite project, since it applies the no-op plugin.</p> <p>Similarly, you can define a completely empty script plugin which brings along extension methods for existing Gradle types and puts them on your project builds' classpath.

If you can write fast, deterministic, easily maintainable tests that give you great confidence by incorporating your third-party dependencies, I think you should do it. However, if those tests would be flaky, slow and burdensome, then you should not do it. With modern hardware and software, I find that it is often possible to write nice tests that incorporate certain elements of your software's runtime that traditionally have been excluded from the scope of \"unit tests\" by puritans. These include the database or the container runtime. My suggestion is that you experiment and do what is most delightful for you and your team.</p> <p>Created on 2025-05-25</p> <p>Updated on 2025-05-25</p>"},{"location":"writing/personal/year-summary-2025/","title":"Year summary: 2025","text":"<p>Organised thematically, and not at all chronologically.</p>"},{"location":"writing/personal/year-summary-2025/#grandma","title":"Grandma","text":"<p>Grandma sadly passed away this year.

On Sundays, the foot traffic for the side of the intersection with a shorter pedestrian green light  is significantly higher, and if the pedestrian green light lasted any longer, the number of people who would be able to leave one side of the crossing would be too great for the size of the island they cross over to on the other side, and they would spill out into the road, causing a hazard. The other side of the intersection doesn't have that problem because the foot traffic on that side there never gets as high.</p> <p>Now that I think I understand why the difference is there, I can in confidence propose how it could be better: The duration of the pedestrian green light should only be shortened on Sunday, rather than on every day.

I find these principles easy to interpret from the perspective of a non-object-oriented programming language (like Rust or Q) as well.</p> <ol> <li>Tests are as fast as possible, given their scope. Tests that have a noticeable total execution time are scrutinized.</li> <li>Tests are deterministic. The test author makes a reasonable effort to preempt and detect flakiness in the tests they write.</li> <li>A test method fails for exactly one reason. That is, there is only one assertion. Tests do not \"ramble\", with many actions and assertions. Such tests are broken up into multiple tests.</li> <li>A unit test class contains tests both for expected, successful outcomes and any other potential outcomes. The former are more important, because they prove that the unit under test can ever possibly work, if nothing goes wrong at all. Later tests, for exceptional or unexpected behaviours are also important, because they help future readers and authors understand exactly how the unit behaves under a diverse range of circumstances.</li> <li>The test author watched the test fail, either because by doing TDD and writing the test before writing the source code that implements the behaviour they are testing, or, by going back and breaking the program's behaviour to make sure the test will actually catch a regression.</li> <li>The test author has honed the test's failure message(s) so that it is easy for others to interpret a failure. The name of the test method, and the name of the test class, also contribute to providing sufficient context, such that the next person to encounter this failing test understands why it failed, what behaviour it is protecting, and how to fix it.</li> <li>Test code is crafted and refactored like production code. Logical entities in the test are extracted into domain-specific classes within the test sources. Duplication is regarded as an opportunity to create meaningful abstractions. Names are deliberated upon, to provide an intuitive reader experience.</li> <li>Tests can be executed locally by developers on their machine, using their own, possibly modified, copy of the code. Use of secret credentials and custom configurations for tests is discouraged, especially if they are present only on CI, and therefore more difficult for new or inexperienced team members to discover.</li> <li>The name of a test should describe a general behaviour that your unit exhibits e.g. \"checks that file exists\" rather than \"throws exception if argument to --file is non-existing file\". Don't put the body of the test in the name of the test.</li> <li>Source code is written with testability in mind. Testability is an essential feature of high-quality production code. Code should be deliberately written in a way that makes it easy for you and other authors to write fast-running automated tests which verify that your program behaves correctly.</li> </ol> <p>Created on 2022-06-07</p> <p>Updated on 2024-01-28</p>"},{"location":"writing/software_development/thoughts-on-spring-dependency-injection/","title":"Thoughts on Spring dependency injection","text":"<p>This page attempts to distill something about Spring's dependency injection framework that has always put me off it: That it superficially improves the experience of code authors, at the expense of code readers.</p> <p>I could make an outrageous straw man argument as I'm sure many others have already done, but actually I don't intend to paint a picture that anything is obviously wrong with Spring's dependency injection.

The code is only exercised during manual testing, done on an actual CI agent. The different branches are tested individually, and in general, the cost of change is quite high. If you choose not to accept a high cost of change, then consumers will pay. Bugs can be missed, and pipelines may break even due to minor issues like typos. Code review will not save you from these things.</p> <p>For changes that have the potential to affect many behaviours of the pipeline library, the manual testing phase will have to cover everything. This will provide a huge barrier to broadly scoped refactorings which would otherwise have the potential to greatly improve your experience of making changes.</p> <p>A lack of tests will also discourage other developers from making changes to the pipeline library. This will make existing maintainers into bottlenecks, which is an unfortunate position to be in. This compounds with the cost of change, because not only are maintainers in a position where they are in-demand bottlenecks, but also they can't safely make refactorings which could make it possible for non-maintainers to make changes.</p> <p>This problem of bottleneck maintainers is especially bad for teams where the pipeline library maintainers are \"part-time\", that is, they are actually meant to be doing feature delivery, but they are also the team's de-facto \"CI person\".

Understanding them well will help you to write a pipeline which works nicely, and where the tests you have for it give you confidence in your changes.</p>"},{"location":"writing/tutorials/unit-testing-for-jenkins-pipeline-libraries/#example-of-a-test","title":"Example of a test","text":"<p>Here's an example of a test from a pipeline library I wrote not too long ago as a personal project, while I was doing more exploration practically in the area of unit testing for pipeline libraries.</p> <pre><code>package stage.clone;\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport org.mockito.InOrder;\nimport org.mockito.Mockito;\nimport pipeline.JobParameters;\nimport pipeline.MockJenkins;\n\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;\nimport static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.*;\nimport static org.mockito.Mockito.verify;\n\npublic class CloneStageTest {\n\n    private final JobParameters jobParameters = new JobParameters(\"https://github.com/robmoore-i/AccountingCalisthenics\");\n\n    @Test\n    void returnsTheCodeDirectoryRelativePath() {\n        MockJenkins jenkins = new MockJenkins();\n        CloneStage stage = new CloneStage(jenkins);\n\n        assertEquals(\"code\", stage.run(jobParameters));\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void ensuresTheCodeDirectoryIsDeletedBeforeCloning() {\n        MockJenkins jenkins = new MockJenkins();\n        CloneStage stage = new CloneStage(jenkins);\n\n        stage.run(jobParameters);\n\n        InOrder inOrder = Mockito.inOrder(jenkins.mock);\n        inOrder.verify(jenkins.mock).sh(\"rm -rf code\");\n        inOrder.verify(jenkins.mock).sh(startsWith(\"git clone\"));\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void clonesTheGivenRepository() {\n        MockJenkins jenkins = new MockJenkins();\n        CloneStage stage = new CloneStage(jenkins);\n\n        stage.run(jobParameters);\n\n        verify(jenkins.mock).sh(\"git clone \" + jobParameters.githubUrl + \" code\");\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void startsTheStage() {\n        MockJenkins jenkins = new MockJenkins();\n        CloneStage stage = new CloneStage(jenkins);\n\n        stage.run(jobParameters);\n\n        verify(jenkins.mock).stage(eq(\"Clone\"), any());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"writing/tutorials/unit-testing-for-jenkins-pipeline-libraries/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Writing automated tests for pipeline libraries can be challenging</p> </li> <li> <p>Growing your pipeline library code without tests will result in the same   problems as you would see from any other codebase that is growing without   tests.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are a few techniques you can apply which will make writing tests for   your pipeline library easier, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Using a build tool, like Gradle</li> <li>Wrap 3rd party interfaces using an Adaptor class</li> <li>Only write tests that give you confidence</li> <li>Invest in really understanding the CI runtime</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Created on 2022-05-28</p> <p>Updated on 2023-03-09</p>"}]}
